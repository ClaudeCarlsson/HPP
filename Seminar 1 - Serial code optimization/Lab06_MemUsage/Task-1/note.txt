How does this affect the performance? Worse

One reason is that the memory allocations (malloc() calls) will
probably become more expensive because there is a larger strain on the operating
systemâ€™s memory management system. Another reason is less efficient cache usage:
if we never call free, each malloc call will give us a completely new memory block
that has not been used before, so it will not be in cache. On the other hand, if we
free the old memory blocks before allocating new ones, it is likely that we will often
be working with partly the same memory addresses, so there is a better chance that
the memory addresses we are using will already be in cache.
